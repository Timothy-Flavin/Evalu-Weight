    <h1>The Beginning</h1>
    <p> Evalu-Weight was created on January, 28th, 2020 as an entry into the Love's cup business competition by Clay Moyer and Tim flavin.
      Evalu-Weight began as an idea of Clay's to quicken the learning curve for new exercises and help to prevent injury in fitness centers.
      The idea consisted of gym equiptment attatchments made to record, analyze, and diagnose form and ability of gym members in order to 
      provide feedback for those who do not want to interact with people or pay for a personal trainor before becomming more comfortable 
      in the gym. The idea required more technical expirience and the Love's cup competition generally accepts teams of two to five and 
      so Tim was contacted to join the competition.
